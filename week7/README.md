## Summary

We finished our `pandas_intro.ipynb` file which introduces us to working with dataframes in pandas.  We modifided columns and exported data the data to a new csv file.

For the last part of the class, I introduced virtual environments with conda.  See the [wiki](https://github.com/seidelj/python-course/wiki/Virtual-Environments) for a brief description and useful commands.
