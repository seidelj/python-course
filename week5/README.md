## Week 5

This week read data into Python and made some modifications to the data under the constraint of not using any libraries/modules outside of the basic Python installation.

You will need to download the roster.csv file on your machine.  You can either access it through a fork or clone of this repo on your local machine or you can download it manually into excel and save as .csv file.

### Summary

The general idea is to first read in the data using the `csv` module.  We stored the in a list of dictionary objects, where each dictionary corresponded to a row in the csv file with each "key" of the key:value pairs corresponding to the column header of the csv.

We used the `random` library to assign fictional grades to each student.  We then further manipulated the data in python using `for` loops and `if` statements.  We also created a custome function to compute the class average.
