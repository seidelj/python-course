### Summary

This week read data into Python and made some modifications to the data under the constraint of not using any libraries/modules outside of the basic Python installation.

You will need to download the roster.csv file on your machine.  You can either access it through a fork or clone of this repo on your local machine or you can download it manually into excel and save as .csv file.
