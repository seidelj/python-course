## Elements notebook

We completed the 'elements' of Python notebook.  The file can be found under the week3 folder.

* I recomend taking a look at the additional information added to the If statements section on `elif` and nested statements.


### Questions from class

Q: Comparing lists with greater than or less than.

A: Python will start by comparing the first items of each list.  If the values are the same, it will move the second values of each list.  Otherwise it will return the result depending on the comparison operater provided.  Some examples:

```
[1, 2, 3] > [1, 3, 4]
> False

[4, 1] > [2, 20, 19]
> True

[1, 4] < [2, 50, 9]
> True

[1, 4] < [1, 50, 9]
> False
```
